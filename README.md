# Jungle Devs - React Challenge

I'll be implementing a simplified version of Hapu’s ‘Become a Nanny Share Host’ view. The concepts that I'm applying are:

- JSX;
- Components, props and state;
- Lifecycle Methods;
- Responsive design with CSS media-queries;
- API calls;
- Error handling;
- Loading states;
- SEO & accessibility;
- A/B tests;
- Production builds.

## Functional Requirements

- User can send name and email to receive newsletter.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Name or email input is required and show an error if empty.
- User must type a valid email, if not it shows an error.
- After user sent the infos correctly the site will give a feedback if everything occurs fine.
- The site is responsive using two main breakpoints.
- Hero Section has an A/B test.

## Tech

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- Marvel App
  - [A/B Test](https://github.com/marvelapp/react-ab-test)

## Run locally in development mode

### Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:ScriptCamilo/jungledevs-challenge.git
```

### Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd jungledevs-challenge
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

or

```bash
  yarn add
```

### Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

or

```bash
  yarn start
```

## Production Build

```bash
  npm run build
```

or

```bash
  yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
